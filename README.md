# ExIgniter.ObjectMapper 3.0

**ExIgniter.ObjectMapper** is an intelligent, high-performance object mapping library for .NET, now even more powerful and streamlined.

Version 3.0.0 delivers:

  * 🚀 **Enhanced performance** through advanced optimization techniques.
  * 🛡️ **Richer configuration options** for fine-grained control over mapping behavior.
  * 🧠 **Smarter, more intuitive property matching** to reduce boilerplate.
  * 🔒 **Robust safety features** including circular reference detection and recursion limits.
  * 🧱 **Comprehensive support** for collections, complex object graphs, and nested structures.

-----

## ✨ Why ExIgniter?

  * ✅ **Zero-configuration** for the vast majority of use cases.
  * ⚡ **Significantly faster** than previous versions in benchmarks.
  * 🌟 **Intelligently matches** common property name variations automatically.
  * 🔄 **Handles nested objects, collections, and dictionaries** with ease and safety.
  * 🛡️ **Security-first design**: features like cycle detection, recursion depth limits, and type whitelisting prevent common mapping pitfalls.

-----

## 📦 Installation

```bash
Install-Package ExIgniter.ObjectMapper
```

**Supports**: `.NET Standard 2.1+`, `.NET 6+`, `.NET 7+`, `.NET 8+`

-----

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🚀 Performance Optimized

  * **Refined reflection caching**: Even quicker lookups.
  * **Reduced allocations**: Minimizing garbage collection overhead.
  * **Optimized mapping strategies**: Faster data transfer.

### 🧠 Intelligent Mapping

Automatically resolves common mismatches and handles complex scenarios:

  * `"UserName"` → `"Username"`
  * `"Addr1"` → `"AddressLine1"`
  * `"ID"` → `"Id"`
  * **Customizable conventions** for unique naming patterns.

### 🔐 Safe and Secure

  * **Advanced cycle detection**: Prevents infinite loops in object graphs.
  * **Configurable max depth limit**: Safeguards against runaway recursion.
  * **Whitelisted types**: Ensures only safe types are instantiated during mapping.

### 🧰 Comprehensive Collection Support

Seamlessly maps diverse collection types:

  * Arrays, Lists, HashSets
  * Dictionaries
  * Queues and Stacks
  * **Custom collection handling** for specific requirements.

## 📊 Benchmarks (v2.0 vs v3.0)

| Scenario        | v2.0    | v3.0    | Speedup (approx.) |
| :-------------- | :------ | :------ | :---------------- |
| Simple Object   | 50ms    | **35ms**| 1.4×                |
| Complex Graph   | 140ms   | **95ms**| 1.5×                |
| Collection (1k) | 70ms    | **45ms**| 1.5×                |

*Benchmarks were performed using representative DTOs and nested entities on .NET 8. Actual results may vary.*
